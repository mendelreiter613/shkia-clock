# How to Deploy Your Shkia Clock

Great news! I have already created your GitHub repository:
👉 **[https://github.com/mendelreiter613/shkia-clock](https://github.com/mendelreiter613/shkia-clock)**

Now, you just need to put it online using Railway.

## Step 1: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app/).
2. Log in (select **GitHub** to log in easily).
3. Click **New Project** > **Deploy from GitHub repo**.
4. You should see `mendelreiter613/shkia-clock` in the list. Select it.
5. Click **Deploy Now**.

## Step 2: That's it!
Railway will do the rest:
- It will install the libraries (`kosher-zmanim`, etc).
- It will build the website.
- In 1-2 minutes, it will give you a public URL (like `shkia-clock-production.up.railway.app`).

Open that URL on your phone, and you are good to go!
